<!--<p><b>Description</b></p>-->

 <p>The company's headquarters is located in Seattle, Washington, United States. As of July 7, 2016, Starbucks is present on 6 continents and in 75 countries and territories, with a total of 23,768 locations. In 2008, Starbucks continued its expansion, settling in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Portugal.</p>
 
 <p>European and Scandinavian expansion continued in 2009 with Poland (April),Utrecht, Netherlands (August), and Sweden at Arlanda Airport outside Stockholm (October).<p>
 
 <p>In 2010, growth in new markets continued. In May 2010, Southern Sun Hotels South Africa announced that they had signed an agreement with Starbucks to brew Starbucks coffees in select Southern Sun and Tsonga Sun hotels in South Africa. The agreement was partially reached so Starbucks coffees could be served in the country in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted by South Africa. In June 2010, Starbucks opened its first store in Budapest, Hungary and in November, the company opened the first Central American store in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.</p>
 
 <p>In December 2010, Starbucks debuted their first ever Starbucks at sea, where with a partnership with Royal Caribbean International; Starbucks opened a shop aboard their Allure of the Seas Royal Caribbean's second largest ship, and also the second largest ship in the world.</p>
 
 <p>Starbucks is planning to open its fourth African location, after South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco, in Algeria. A partnership with Algerian food company Cevital will see Starbucks open its first Algerian store in Algiers.</p>
 
 <p>In January 2011, Starbucks and Tata Coffee, Asia's largest coffee plantation company, announced plans for a strategic alliance to bring Starbucks to India and also to source and roast coffee beans at Tata Coffee's Kodagu facility. Despite a false start in 2007, in January 2012, Starbucks announced a 50:50 joint venture with Tata Global Beverages called Tata Starbucks. Tata Starbucks will own and operate Starbucks outlets in India as Starbucks Coffee "A Tata Alliance". Starbucks opened its first store in India in Mumbai on October 19, 2012</p>
 
 
<p><b>Licensed and franchise operations</b></p>

<p>Independently operated Starbucks locations exist. Stores that independently operate locations include Ahold Delhaize, Barnes & Noble, Target, and Tom Thumb stores. As of 2015, 4,962 licensed locations exist.</p>

<p>In the EMEA markets, Starbucks holds a franchising program. Different to the License program in which existing corporations may apply to operate a Starbucks kiosk within an existing store, Franchises have the ability to create new freestanding stores.</p>
