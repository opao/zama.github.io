    <br>
       A number of Customer Analytics tables have PII data and other attributes which uniquely identify a person. This data should be used only when necessary and shouldn't be shared without obfuscating PII-related data and characteristics. Such data may be used in aggregate and after these characteristics have been anonymized.

<p>The following is an overview of the major business concepts used in Customer Analytics.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Customer </li>
<li>Product </li>
<li>Merchant </li>
<li>Channel </li>
<li>Loyalty & Star Rewards </li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Customer</b></p>
<p>Customer is defined as a consumer that has made a transaction at a Starbucks retail store or non-retail store. Customers are typically grouped into 'registered' (those that have registered at starbucks.com and/or have activated the mobile app) vs. 'unregistered' and 'active' (those customers that have made a recent transaction) vs. 'non-active.' The most common way of identifying a customer across all tables and views is through the GUID (customer unique identification).</p>

<p>Customer segmentation is done in numerous ways based on frequency of visits (e.g. weekend vs. weekday), types of purchases (e.g. food vs. beverage), times of visit (e.g. breakfast vs. lunch vs. afternoon), seasonality (e.g. fall pumpkin spice latte vs. winter peppermint latte), current loyalty tier (e.g. gold, green, none), spend thresholds, transaction types, card redemption / reload / activation, etc.<p>


<p><b>Product</b></p>
<p>Product is defined as the unique item that a Customer purchases. All product details are accessible through the Item and Auxiliary Item tables. There are two main classifications of items: base items and modifiers. Base items are the essential components of the product (e.g. espresso, coffee, etc.) whereas modifiers are modifications to the base product (e.g. extra hot, extra shot, vanilla-flavored, etc.). Additionally, products are classified as revenue SKUs (priced) or non-revenue SKUs (non-priced). Examples of non-priced items are things like extra hot, dry, wet, etc. One additional level of classification is through the Department, Sub-Department, Class, Sub-Class, Category and Sub-Category ragged hierarchy. The 'IS_' fields (e.g. IS_ESPRESS_BEV, IS_BEV, etc.) in the Auxiliary Item table can be used as a multiplier in queries as well to determine item quantities.</p>

<p><b>Merchant</b></p>
<p>Merchant is an entity that represents a group of stores or locations where Starbucks products are sold. Merchant is classified in a number of ways based on company ownership and merchant type. Here are the major groupings of Merchant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity (aka ‘Company Owned’): An ‘Equity’ Merchant is the classification for any company owned stores operated in the US, UK and Canada</li>
<li>Franchise (aka ‘Licensed’): A ‘Franchise’ Merchant is the classification for stores in EMEA as well as licensed stores (e.g. Target, Safeway, Kroger, HMS host for airport locations) </li>
<li>Joint Venture: A ‘Joint Venture’ Merchant is the classification for stores in Mexico and India</li>
</ul>
<p>Level of granularity in the transaction changes based on the data source and type of Merchant that reports the data. For example, Equity (aka ‘Company Owned’) Merchants report the full details (line level detail) of the transaction whereas for Franchise (aka ‘Licensed’ Stores) only provide the full ticket details (header/summary).</p>


<p><b>Channel</b></p>
<p>Channel is one of the most widely used and most diversely defined terms across Starbucks and can be used in any number of contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tender Channel – used to define the type of Payment</li> 
<li>Buying Channel – used to define if the transaction from in-store or drive-thru</li>
<li>Communication Channel – defined as type of channel used to interact with the customer (e.g. e-mail, phone, in-app, etc.)</li>
<li>Store Channel – used to define Merchant classification (i.e. Equity vs. Franchise)</li>
<li>Alternative Distribution Channel – used to identify cards sold in a Franchise store</li>
<li>Unknown Channel – used for transactions against Merchants that have never been seen</li>
<li>And so on…
</ul>
<p>When reviewing any Channel related data or collection of data it is best to be specific about the methodology and algorithms that were used to define the Channel.</p>


<p><b>Loyalty & Star Rewards</b></p>
<p>Customers who participate in the loyalty program are called MSR customers (i.e. My Starbucks Rewards). On April 12th, My Starbucks Rewards was renamed to Starbucks Rewards. Customers are assigned unique membership identification in each country where their Starbucks card is registered. Currently, not all countries participate in the MSR program.</p>


<p><b>Mobile</b></p>
<p>Mobile devices are uniquely identified by the Device ID and are tied to a specific GUID (see the Customer overview above for more details on the GUID). Additional customer analysis can be performed based on the type of mobile device that a customer uses. App data is available for analysis as well (e.g. latest App download history, most recent update date, etc.)</p><br>
